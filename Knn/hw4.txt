1. In general, as the number of folds decreases:
   - The average elapsed time of the classification of 1 fold in the cross validation increases,
   because in each fold there are more instances.
   - The total elapsed time for the classification in the cross validation decreases.
   The above is correct referring to the non-edited KNN,
   since pruning the data means that we decrease the number
   of instances that are being used for classification.

2. There is a connection between our answer for the first question to
   the number of instances that we used in the classification.
   We can see from the printed results that as the number of folds decreases,
   the number of instances used in the classification phase also decreases.
   Therefore, the total elapsed time for the classification in the cross
   validation decreases, because we are making less classifications.
