We are not satisfied with some of our results:

1. Chi Pruning:
  - First of all we can see that when building the classifier with pre
    pruning of Chi Sqaure Test, the classifier is much worse than flipping a coin...
  - Also, it doesn't make sense that pruning gives us a larger avg error than no pruning.
  - In addition, the number of rules (5) in this iteration is quite odd.

2. Rule Pruning - It doesn't make sense that pruning gives us a larger avg error than no pruning.
